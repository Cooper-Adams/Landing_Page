# Landing_Page

A test that examines the skills I have developed through the previous studies and activities so far.
Building an entire webpage based off of a model image is fun, if not a little frustrating. I like to be specific with dimensions,
so a lot of trial and error went into trying to match the model image in some places, though eventually I reread the prompt
and it occurred to me that I did not, infact, have to have every border correct down to its last pixel. Overall it was really fun to attempt and put my own flair into it, and hopefully I can revisit and add on as I discover new things to customize.
